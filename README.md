Recipes html lesson

This project required me to use the HTML, git and command line lessons I had on The Odin Project up to this point!
I was really to cool to put up a little website using this knowlage and made me feel confident in the way things are being taught in this course!
I had no problems or bugs wile doing this lesson!
